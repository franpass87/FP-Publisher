# Final Audit Checklist

## Repository Hygiene
- Verified `.gitignore` excludes vendor directories, build outputs, and binary assets, preventing accidental commits of compiled artifacts or dependencies.
- Confirmed `git ls-files` contains no binary or minified assets such as images, archives, maps, or pre-built bundles.
- Checked `.rebuild-state.json` to ensure the project is marked at phase 14 with all phases completed and no outstanding todos.

## Security & Compliance
- Reviewed option storage to confirm tokens are encrypted when Sodium is available and sanitized when saved or retrieved.
- Audited capability registration and admin gating to ensure every admin entry point performs role checks and nonce validation where required.
- Ensured REST routes consistently sanitize input, enforce capability checks, and return redacted error information.

## Scheduling & Queueing
- Validated database migrations create the required tables with appropriate indexes, including idempotency constraints on jobs and unique slugs for short links.
- Confirmed the worker, scheduler, and queue services cooperate to respect blackout windows, concurrency limits, and exponential backoff with jitter during retries.
- Inspected replay logic to guarantee failed jobs can be safely retried without duplicating remote executions when a remote identifier already exists.

## Connectors & Alerts
- Checked connector dispatchers (Meta, TikTok, YouTube, Google Business, WordPress) for consistent token refresh flows, dry-run support, and normalized error handling.
- Ensured Instagram first-comment jobs spawn child tasks through the queue with idempotent safeguards against duplicate comments.
- Reviewed smart alert cron jobs for daily token expiry and weekly scheduling gap emails, including reusable email templates without PII leakage.

## Admin Experience & Assets
- Verified the admin SPA shell mounts a single-page experience with localized strings and routes for accounts, calendar, templates, alerts, settings, and logs.
- Confirmed only source TypeScript/CSS assets are committed and no compiled bundles or maps live under `assets/`.
- Reviewed short-link rewrite rules and REST CRUD handlers to guarantee 302 redirects append stored UTM data while tracking aggregate click metrics only.

## Documentation
- Cross-checked domain, queue, connector, UTM, and resume documentation to ensure they describe the implemented systems and contributor workflows accurately.
- Noted the README "Delta della fase" history remains aligned with the final implementation for quick onboarding references.

All audit checks passed without requiring code changes.
