# Editorial calendar

The editorial calendar helps teams plan, approve, and publish social posts from one shared timeline.

## Navigating the calendar

* Use the **Month** and **Week** toggle to change the timeline density.
* Filter the view by channel or campaign tags with the toolbar at the top.
* Drag and drop cards to reschedule them; the worker will recalculate dispatch windows automatically.

## Creating posts

1. Click **New post** on any empty slot or use the shortcut button in the top right corner.
2. Choose the target channels; the composer will adapt attachment requirements per channel.
3. Fill the copy, media, and call-to-action details then click **Save draft**.
4. Assign the draft to an approver or set the post to auto-approve.

## Approvals and statuses

Drafts move through the following states:

| Status | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Draft | Waiting for an author to complete the content. |
| Review | Sent to approvers; reminders are scheduled via alerts. |
| Scheduled | Approved and queued for the worker to publish. |
| Published | Dispatched to the remote channel with a remote ID stored in logs. |
| Failed | Publishing failed; see the alerts panel for recovery actions. |

## Tips for busy teams

* Use the **Density toggle** to show more cards when planning several channels.
* Activate **Best time suggestions** in Settings to receive channel-specific timing hints.
* Enable **Auto tagging** in the connector options to apply campaign labels automatically.
