# Short links

The short link feature generates branded redirect URLs for every post so you can track engagement across channels.

## Enabling short links

1. Go to **FP Publisher → Settings → Links**.
2. Toggle **Enable short links** and choose the preferred slug prefix.
3. Configure the retention period for archived links if you want to keep historical records in the database.

## Creating links

* Short links are generated automatically when a post is scheduled with a tracked URL.
* Editors can preview and copy the link from the composer sidebar.
* Use the **Regenerate** action to refresh the slug if it was already used.

## Analytics

The **Links** tab shows click totals, last access time, and status (active or archived). Export the table as CSV to combine with external analytics tools.

## Housekeeping

Old links are archived by the housekeeping service according to the retention policy. Archived links keep their stats but the redirect is disabled until restored.
