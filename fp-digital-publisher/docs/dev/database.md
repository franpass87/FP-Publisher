# Database schema

FP Publisher provisions custom tables to manage the publishing queue, link shortener, and job archive. The migrations run automatically during plugin activation and upgrades.

## Tables

Stores pending and historical jobs.

| `channel` | varchar(50) | Connector slug. Indexed for filtering. |
| `status` | varchar(20) | Draft, scheduled, running, completed, failed. Indexed. |
| `run_at` | datetime | Next execution window. Indexed for worker queries. |
| `idempotency_key` | varchar(64) | Unique constraint to avoid duplicate scheduling. |

### `wp_fp_pub_links`

## Migrations

Migrations live in `src/Infra/DB/Migrations.php` and run sequentially based on the stored schema version. Each migration is idempotent; it checks for table and column existence before applying changes.

## Retention settings

Administrators can configure retention thresholds via **Settings â†’ Housekeeping**. The values control when jobs move from the live table to the archive and when temporary assets are purged.
